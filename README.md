# CDCAUTOPWN
This is a tool designed to auto-pwn CDC teams at the Iowa State Cyber Defence
Competitions. It should work for any CDC using IScorE, but YMMV. 

Due to the nature of this tool, ***DO NOT*** run this outside of an ISEAGE
environment. You will likely get a knock on your door from some angry men in
suits if you do.
